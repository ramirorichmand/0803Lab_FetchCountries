# 08/03/23 Lab Fetch Countries

Using an external API, I constructed a front-end app which populates a page with dynamic information. We're talking fetch() requests, we're talking DOM manipulation and we're talking user input.

We've explored the fundamentals of JavaScript and had a refresher of HTML and CSS. Now that we're familiar with the DOM, let's take this a step further and attempt to bring all our learning together.

Using an external API, let's begin constructing a front-end app which populates a page with dynamic information. We're talking **`fetch()` requests**, we're talking **DOM manipulation** and we're talking **user input**.

## Set-Up 🎯

This afternoon lab may seem quite intimidating so we're going to first lay out a start point for you. Instead of providing one, we're going to talk through the steps to get you familiar with the code patterns:

- **Step 1: HTML**

  - Open up VSCode and create a new HTML file
  - Using Emmet abbreviation (`!` or `html:5`) or by typing it yourself, set up a basic HTML template
  - Add a heading (`h1`) to the `body` followed by a `section`
  - Give your `section` a distinct `id`

- **Step 2: JS**

  - Again within VSCode, create a new JS file
  - Move back to your HTML file and connect your JS file using the `script` tag and your filepath in the `src` attribute
  - Remember to include `defer` to your `script` tag so it runs after the HTML loads!
  - Back in your JS file, add in a simple `console.log("HI!")`

- **Step 3: In the browser**

  - Open up your HTML file in the browser by right-clicking your file and then selecting `Open With > Google Chrome`
  - Your webpage will be blank save the heading added earlier
  - Right click the page in the browser and select `Inspect`
  - At the top right, select the `Console`
  - Check that your `"HI!"` statement is printed there
  - If the message doesn't appear, check that your files are saved and that the filepath in the `script` tag is correct

- **Step 4: Familiarisation of the Countries API**

  - Have a look at API endpoint which returns all held information on all countries within their set: [https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all](https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all)
  - This will be difficult to parse so let's install the Chrome JSON Formatter extension [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/json-formatter/bcjindcccaagfpapjjmafapmmgkkhgoa/related]()
  - Refresh the endpoint page to see the output in a clearer format
  - Familiarise yourself with the rough structure of the output
  - Now, let's visit another endpoint [https://restcountries.com/v3.1/name/peru](https://restcountries.com/v3.1/name/peru)
  - Familiarise yourself with this structure and consider how this relates to the previous endpoint's output

- **Step 5: Creating our `fetch()` request**
  - In your JS file, create a function called `getCountryByName()`
  - Give this function one argument, `countryName`
  - Within the function place a `fetch()` request which points towards the `https://restcountries.com/v3.1/name/{countryName}` endpoint
  - Don't use the format above, rather use string interpolation to include the argument in your URL
  - Following your `fetch()` request, put in a `.then()` which takes the `response` and puts it into JSON format (`response => response.json()`)
  - Within one more `.then()` statement, print your response data to the console (`data => console.log(data)`)
  - Call your function at the bottom of your JS file, giving it a valid country name
  - Play about, see how the API behaves for diffetent inputs

## Lab Task 🔬

From the set-up task above, we have our response from the Rest Countries API printing to the console for a provided country. Your tasks are to:

1. **Take the output from your `getCountryByName()` function and make use of it on the webpage.** You'll need to access specific properties within the returned object, such as `name`. This will also involve you creating a variable associated with the `section` created earlier and making use of the `createElement()` and `.append()` methods
2. **Modify your code to additionally display the population** of the specified country on your webpage
3. **Create a `getAllCountries()` function** which similarly displays the name and population of **each** country to the frontend. See the tip below about abstracting your functionality. Have this method called on page load

**Tips:**

- Remember that you can use bracket notation `objectName[#]` to access items in an array (or object) at the specified index `#`
- You can also use dot notation (`object.property`) to access values of the specified `property`
- [MDN - Create Element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/createElement)
- [MDN - Append Method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/append)
- When you create JS functionality for adding your object properties to, for instance, a `p` element, it would make sense to create this as a separate function (abstracted function) which accepts the data of **one country**. This is so you can easily reuse this functionality during the later tasks
- [MDN - innerHTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/innerHTML)

## Extensions 📚

4. **Extend your webpage to include some more information about the countries and some basic styling** (for instance, you could make use of the `flag` property which holds a URL to an image of the country's flag).
5. **Create an HTML form** which allows you to input the name of a country which is used to "filter" the information on the front-end on-submit. This will call your `getCountryByName()` function
6. **Make your page header dynamic**, displaying whether data is still being fetched or has completed. This will be tied to your previously created methods. Again, this will likely involve `Element.innerHTML`
7. **Make your header display whether an error has occurred** when fetching data (such as when an invalid country name is inputed) — see tip below


**Tips:** 💡

- Note that while we have said "filter the information" above, we are actually creating a new `fetch()` request, which is then adding **additional information** to your front-end. You will, hence, have to clear the country information already on the front-end when you submit your form. `Element.innerHTML = {value}` may be helpful here
- You can check whether a `fetch()` request has been successful by querying the response within your initial `.then()`, as the returned object contains an `ok` property which is of Boolean type. Remember to collect together your functionality within your `.then()`s using curly brackets `{}` if you are doing more than one thing with the returned information!
